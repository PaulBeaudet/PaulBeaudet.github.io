Another fun day bagging some peaks.

Mountains were a bit socked in early on, so pictures start at Wildcat A looking into Cater Notch where some birds of prey were hunting.

The view into the notch is pretty spectacular. This picture is just 2 dimensions. The south side of south carter in the far off past slid right into the notch and form what are the ramparts which are the rock piles near the hut compound featured above. The rock slide is very apparent from this view from the top of Wildcat. The scale of it is a bit mind bending to think about.

I definitely thought that more of the notch was in this picture. Think I need a better viewfinder

There was a wedding on the top of the mountain by the time we got back.

Back down the ski trail with some pretty great views along the way.

Unfortunately I forgot to record the track for this one.
