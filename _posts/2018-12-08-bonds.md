Weekend hike up to Bondcliff and all the Bonds. The cover photo is Olivia and Becca posing on the rock the juts out of the Bondcliff and drops a few hundred feet. Probably should have switched in the wide angle for scale, but it would be hard to tell who's posing. Was too nervous that either of them were getting too close to the edge.

Olivia and Becca at the handing out by the falls. This hike can be done as a one or two day trek. In this case both. Starting a the Zealand trailhead our plan was to touch the tops of Mount Zealand, West Bond, Bond, and Bondcliff.

Views of Bondcliff from West Bond. The sky's were a bit hazy from so much heat an humidity, the hike to this point was a sweaty one for sure.

Sunset just beyond twin. Was too bad for the folk before us that went back to camp they were sure nothing was going to happen. Also witnessed some yellow lightning just beyond Garfield. The color must have been strange because of the time of day and haze.


This is Becca's track from this trip, she went straight through from Zealand to Lincoln woods!
