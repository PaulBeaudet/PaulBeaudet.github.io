Another warm winter day in the 50s with some awesome lookouts from Shaw and Bald Knob

Started things out with a quick but steep climb up Bald Knob

From the Knob to the Snout we were mostly planting fresh foot prints. Just missing a hiker hitting Shaw while we were on Black Snout

Along the way we were startled by a furry friend, I think she was startled by us as well and hurried away quickly, almost missed this shot

The view from Shaw towards Washington was quite striking

Stopping to see some falls as were coming towards the end of the trail
