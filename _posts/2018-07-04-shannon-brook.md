Bridal Vail Falls. I've shot this one a couple of times, still feel like I could get a better shot. Guess that means I'll have to go back again.

 It was a good 4th of July hike with Karyn and John.

John almost ran into this guy and he quickly scurried up the tree. John is not the tree beaver. I would say maybe the beaver's name is Ferdinande.
