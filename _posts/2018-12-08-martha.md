Chilly day up in Carrol NH with temps in the teens. Things started off frigid and was easier to keep a personal temp with a healthy climb up Martha.

Most of the trail was well packed but there were many parts that required snow shoes.

Pictures of the view on top of Martha. The Prezi range seen through the crisp and clear winter air is really spectacular.

There was a bit of an interesting couple of scrambles to get up Owls Head but it was worth the while. May require crampons as the season goes on but we got up and down them with snow shoes.
