It was a beautiful day in the white mountains. A great time to tackle the Tripyramids with a group of hiking buddies. Supposedly the trail was going to be difficult going up the Tripyramid trail so we detoured up the Scaur Ridge Trail. Not before missing the trail and taking and unexpected moose tracking adventure further down the Livermore trail.

Brian and Anthony back tracking on the Livermore trail to get back to the Scaur ridge trail. No worries, the trail is clearly marked, we were just distracted.

The ridge trail was a fairly easy haul to the top where it meets make up with the Tripyramid trail. Here is Brain among the ridge line trees at the summit.

We had some worry that the south slide might warrant an out and back. As it turns out the best views are going down the south slide.

The slide took some time to navigate, but felt safe, particularly in the fair weather conditions.

Further towards the bottom of the slide the rocks sand became more loose but solid footing was definitely still manageable. A couple that past our group on the way down the slide mention that the north slide was similarly navigable. No regrets on the Scaur Ridge trail though, it provided a steady way for the group to get up.

Don't go chasing waterfalls. Mainly they are not going to try to run a way, any more so than they do in on place.
