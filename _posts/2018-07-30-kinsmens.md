After a sleepless night camping in a fruitless attempt to get to the mountain early we started up cannon to conquer 3 four thousand footers. Cannon, North and Sound Kinsmen

Getting up Cannon via the Kinsmen Ridge trail is a steep climb that takes a lot of energy out.

Mostly a lot of ledges, large rocks, and eroded corridors.

Some wildflowers, would have been nice to have the telephoto on for this one.

Becca and I were thinking of our friend Mellisa on this point of the trail.

The plan was an out and back, but by the time we where out it was going to be really late and steep to get back. So we took our exit towards lonesome lake down the Fishing Jimmy Trail.

Fishing Jimmy is a pretty unique trail with ups and downs, rocks and ledges, board walks and waterfalls. We exited at Lonesome lake and had some dinner as the sunset behind the ridge. From here we hightailed it back to the car in the dark. Which was still 3.7 miles away, guess we should have planted a car. Ironically we had gone to Lafayette place for a bathroom break before we started. Would have made the trip a bit shorter. Our pace went up quite a bit as we tried to get to the car just before 10.

Track of the trek below.
