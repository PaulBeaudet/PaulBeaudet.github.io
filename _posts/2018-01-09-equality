## What does technology mean to me?

Even if you're an atheist, for a moment put your perception in the eyes of higher power.
Realize that humanity is a group of hairless apes and look at them like you would look at any other group of animals.
Would you see as many differences among people as you do now?

Humans are all basically the same creatures in this view.
Discriminating subtle unique features is a process of survival among and inside sub groups of life.
Where a narrow difference of strength, endurance, and consideration are keenly discriminated.
Often difference that defines survivability.
As a higher power there are no such consequences.

Call to question if all of these narrow differences define the survivability of the species or the individual seeds.
Humans pass on more than their genetic traits, they also pass on tools of survivability.
Technology that bridge gaps between individuals. 
In that light what differences really matter?
When do differences become a matter of verity as opposed to a matter of superiority?
