Great day for hike with new trail friend Travis

Hopped over part of the falls and climbed a fallen tree to get this one

I was babbling a bit to Travis about shutter speed and waterfalls. So, excuse this last bit to conclude the babble. Also went on about why a tripod and ND filter is a good idea until you are trying to get a picture in the middle of a stream and end up wanting to shot hand held anyway.


Now the picture above is not my best work but it is interesting taken hand held at a slow 1/2 of a second vs the picture below that is re-framed slightly closer to the same subject and shot at a less slow 15th of a second. To me its amazing that it is almost free of blur. Its hard to tell if I'm loosing sharpness/detail to stopping down to f22 or blur from hand shake. This is shot with the 7-14mm at 8mm and the in body stabilization on.


Suffice it to say I probably need a ND filter to get more of and effect and quality out of this type of shot

I took three of the first shot as if maybe my arm was going to magically become a tripod in one of them. After some more babble I took this one. Only because I mentioned to Travis that I have a poor habit trying the same thing an expecting different results and being frustrated to find I took many of the same pictures later. "I know it will work at a 15th... ah ... I guess I should actually take a minute and do that to compare later." And here we are.
