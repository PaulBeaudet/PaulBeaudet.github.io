Walking around the tip of dingle. Unsure how long, probably 22 miles or so, probably should have worn sunscreen

Sign said Star Wars sunset walk, so I took a detour. Definitely missed it, this will suffice. Supposedly this area was the set when they got kicked off of Skellig Michael which is the island in the middle of the cover photo. The set leftovers I think where on a cliff by the golf course, featured below. It looked like part of the cliff face with the path to it had fell into the ocean. I decided that I might want avoid the same fate. Unlike the Cliffs of Kerry or Moher the fence was only there to keep the livestock in place.

This picture barely does a justice, its on pretty serious hill with a 360 view of the dingle tip. This picture looks towards the cliffs featured above (The Three Sisters?), here they are barely visible in the center of the horizon line. To the left is the cliff face mentioned above. The sandy beach bay is featured below. The Rocks in the foreground are jetting up out of the hill top about 15 feet or so. They looked like castle ruins from afar. Not sure what its called google maps sucks for this type of thing.

That waterfall flows into this bay, where the powerful rip currents can be heard rocking and shifting stones on the beach. The people standing close to water probably have a death wish.

A waterfall that flows into the bay above. Just take the ladders over the electric fence

I think I was lost in a cow field at this point. Fresh pies everywhere. Farmer must have moved them in the morning, which is why where I was supposed to go was roped off.

Growing out of the walls on the side of the road.

Lets be honest Cromwell probably just speed up the process for these things.

Every time I wondered where the rest of it went

Probably the safer beach to play in the water
