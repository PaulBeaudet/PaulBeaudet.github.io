Heading up the snow was pretty well packed on the trail

Getting up the mountain the snow got a bit deeper

The broken trail stopped at a sharp incline, we proceeded to break the trail to the top

At the trail junction we got a better reference of snow depth

Don't remember this trail being so close to the edge

Was safe enough when focused on the trail ahead

The bridge that always feels further away then when the journey started
