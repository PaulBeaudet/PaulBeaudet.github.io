Started with a hike up the rattle snakes.

Then down to the five finger point.

The trail lead to a few small beaches

This one had a bit of a surprise waiting for me in the cracks

Almost stepped on this wiggle worm, we scared each other quite a bit. Slithered into the water in a hurry, but just as fast came back to the rocks to continue sunning itself.

After a run back to the car headed to the campsites and went for a swim in the lake.

Starting from the top, the next day was a drizzly climb up North Twin.

Crossing the little river is a point of concern on this trail. Maybe multiple times depending on how you do it. It was safely manageable given the water levels. A down poor would increase the difficulty of this hike. Particularly this spot, but I imagine many of the trails might turn into streams and rocks on the climb would become slick in the right situation. luckily rain just came in and out for us.
