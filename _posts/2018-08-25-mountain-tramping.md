Slug tripping on a mushroom.

Tramping as many mountains off the list before the end of summer. This post includes pictures from Monroe, Washington, Middle Carter, South Carter, Adams, and Madison.

On our first day we tackled Monroe and Washington. Plan A was to go all the way to the Appalachia trail head where Mudkip was waiting, but this would have set us hiking into the night. Plan B was to hike down the Jewel Trail.

Looking down at Monroe and the Lakes of the Clouds Hut while climbing Washington. Things were pretty clear at this point.

Waited in line to touch the top. As we got to the top most of the surrounding mountains got socked in so pictures end here.

Here was the track for Washington.

After fighting the rain and some sleep deprivation for a day we decide to go for Middle and South Carter. This picture is from the Imp Face on the way up.

Say hello to my mushroom friend!

The Carters ended up being pretty easy going for two 4k peaks. Despite being tired we made some good time.

The next day we decide to make another go at Adams and Madison.

I believe this is the Grey Knob hut. As seen from the Airline trail on the other side of King Ravine.

Happy to get to the top of Adams. Bit of advisory for those heading up Adams via the Airline, King Ravine or Vally Way if you want to take some of the edge off with the rocky last stretch of the Air Line. This part can easily be avoided by taking the Gulf Side trail to Lowe's Path or vice versa from the top. Longer but probably faster, unless of course you're adept at bolder hoping or like that type of challenge.

Looking towards Adams and Star Lake while climbing Madison. At the end of this we were both beat. If I had known better we would have gone back down Valley way. Instead we went down the Daniel Webster Path to get back to camp. I think I may have under estimated the trail description of "Steep towards the top". They meant like a good portion of the top, like 1/3 of the way down was potential ankle breaking, slow going, relentless boulder hopping. Like small boulders that might be described as larger rocks. I lamented a bit about being over descriptive must only hurt the feelings of engineers and editors. Though I'm sure the severity was augmented by our exhaustion a bit.

Here was the track for Adams and Madison.
