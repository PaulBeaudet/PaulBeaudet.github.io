Started as a misty day in the mountains. Things cleared up as the day went on. Karyn, Travis, and I decided on a longer loop up Orange mountain and around Firescrew. Instead of Karyn's original idea of going right up the Holt trail.

Fire Tower on Cardigan.

View of the peak and a peak of some of the lookout tower support structures.

Looks like a pretty well taken care of cabin by the AMC.

Hanging out for a summit lunch. Pop tarts and cucumbers.

Actually I think Travis and Karyn ate something normal like a sandwich. Only the cool people bring pop tarts.

Creeping on more by-standards from the fire tower.

Travis the grotto cave man.

Another picture from the cave area. Fell on some rocks and scaled a small cliff to get to this little pile of rocks. If more into the journey then the destination then 10 out of 10 would fall again.

Going to start experimenting with time-lapse again.

Some say its impossible to squeeze water out of a rock, but we drank from this one.
