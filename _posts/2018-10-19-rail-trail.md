Had a bit of curiosity if hiking to Uncanoonuc from Manchester was practical. Maybe if a friend picks you up, biking might make more sense.

Started in Manchester by the river walk the garage construction on commercial st is coming along. Looks like they'll be able to park the city in there.

The rail trail is relatively uneventful. Foot bridge is operational near the ice arena even though there are still sign that say the path ends. Found this bird of prey circling around by the prison.

End of the trail. The rail trail itself was pretty quick to cover. Out and back is easily a day hike adventure if into that type of thing.

Damn in Goffstown.

Getting to the Uncanoonucs was a bit more eventful with some wild life along the way. Mostly on the road. Deciding on the way to go was a bit of a toss. Might suggest a different way than the one taken. Probably makes more sense to keep on down Mountain Road to the Northern most North Uncannoonuc trail head.

Too close to the road.

Seemed like this used to be a bike trail, but it was difficult to find a follow given all the logging activity.

South Uncanoonuc from Worthley hill road. Which is more like an unmaintained right of way or fire road than an actual road.

Explored the top of south to burn some time, but the main goal was meeting up with Becca to get some photos on north.

Towers are clear this close.

Four second exposure. Remembered North to have no views from the top but clearly I failed to explore very carefully act the top last time I went.

Got a little too dark to get anymore landscapes, so we tried our hands at some light painting.

Raul and Bella seem like some cool people.
