## Bio

Personally I see technology as a force to empower people. My passion for making that gets directed into, programing, prototyping, entrepreneurship, and photography. Many say I'm smart, I'm less apt to self ascribe such a quality and that's more about awareness than modesty. The more learned the more realized how little is understood. There is always someone that knows something more or different, this is why its important to work together. Mostly I see myself as persistent, ready to learn, undeterred by complexity. After all confronting the scary is the only way to be brave. I'm minimalist in a number of senses of the term. Most importantly minimalism to me is having components that get used to a focused end, more than it is about having less components. My focuses are driven by problems of empowerment and sustainability.

Co-founded Manchester Makerspace in 2015, and currently serve as its educational programs manager and as a Board Member at Large. I'm advocate of community workspaces and the context for hands on self-actuated learning.

For fun I like to get out into nature and have hiked the 48 NH 4000 footers in the White Mountains. Many of the post on this site cover those adventures.
